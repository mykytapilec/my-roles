## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend (Server)

1. Navigate to the `server` folder:
   ```bash
   cd server

2. Install dependencies:
    npm install

3. Create environment variables file .env:
    PORT=8000
    # Add any other required variables here

4. Start the server:
    npm run dev

    The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

5. Run server tests:
    npm run test

### 2. Frontend (Web)

1. Navigate to the web folder:
    cd web

2. Install dependencies:
    npm install

3. Create environment variables file .env.local:
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

4. Start the development server:

- Dark mode toggle
- Snackbar notifications for updates and errors

---

## Assumptions / Tradeoffs
- Roles are fixed: 'admin', 'editor', 'viewer'.
- No authentication implemented in this demo version.
- Frontend uses mocked behavior for tests; backend validation required for production.
- UI library: Material-UI (MUI v7)
- Server assumes standard REST API endpoints /users and /users/:id/roles.
